# fpga-graph-accelerator-hls
This repository contains all the codes we used in our 8th Semester, Final Year Project, 2021. 

We considered four graph algorithms, namely, Breadth-First-search, Depth-First-Search, Single Source Shortest Path and PageRank in this project. 
The graph dataset considered has 4720 nodes and 27444 edges. 
The naming convention followed is N/V - number of nodes and E/MAX - number of edges.
