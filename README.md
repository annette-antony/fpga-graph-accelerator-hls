# fpga-graph-accelerator-hls

This repository contains all the codes for our 8th Semester, final year project 2021. The aim of our project was to develop a custom FPGA accelerator for graph processing using High Level Synthesis.

We considered four graph algorithms, namely, Breadth-First-search, Depth-First-Search, Single Source Shortest Path, and PageRank. 

The graph datasets are uploaded in each folder as required.

The naming convention followed in the codes is N/V - number of nodes and E/MAX - number of edges.

For further details, please refer to the Project Report.
